twitter,Trevor Milton,Coward’s run leaders stay and fight for integrity.
podcast,Trevor Milton,"I can assume any role [I] want[] at any time, whenever it needs and all . . . roles report directly up to the executive chairman . . . in other words, the CEO reports directly to me and I have the ability to . . . assume or manage any division, any person . . . anyone inside the company, any given time I need to, because they believe that I have . . . more knowledge and more vision than anyone in the company. And so they wanted to make sure I had no restrictions on that."
podcast,Trevor Milton,"The most important [sic] is that I fully control the board at all times and have people who work well with my personality….No one sees the future like I do, and if you get too many world class brilliant people on the board, you will end up fighting over everything as they think they are the smartest in the room every time."
podcast,Trevor Milton,"I’m not trying to ever be too confident or – or brag about things, but this is important to help you understand that answer. There’s two people in this world that know EVs better than anyone, and that’s Elon and myself. There’s no one in this world that – I can go into any meeting with Volkswagen, Daimler, Volvo. You could put 30 PhDs in that room, and I would run circles around every one of them. Because they only know one thing, that’s all they know. . . . So there’s very few people that know the EV industry or the whole entire vehicle like I do or like Elon does, so we’re probably the top two guys in the world that know this shit, and we know it better than anybody."
news,Trevor Milton,"Well, I don’t think that the market really – this is I think one of the things that many people have missed. The investors around the world right now are tired; they’re tired of like an executive sitting in an office behind his chair, making millions of dollars and, you know, forgetting about the average factory worker or even the consumer. So, there’s unparalleled contact between myself, the executive chairman and the founder of Nikola, and all of our fans. I mean, you heard in the previous segment about social media, there’s a lot of negative in social media, but there’s also a lot of positive that you can create with it. And I took the, uh, I took the decision I wanted to create the positive . . . . And through this social media experience, where people can actually feel like they’re part of it, they can talk to you, they can ask you questions, the transparency, the, the market they’re just tired of the older executive that just don’t care. And that’s why you see the market evaluation of Nikola do well is because finally there’s executives out there that they can talk to, that they can voice their problems, their opinions with and they actually get a response. Go on my Twitter Nikola Trevor and you’ll see . . . you’ll literally see answers to probably two thirds of every tweet out there. "
trial,Trevor Milton,that’s how you build a foundation. Love it.
youtube,Trevor Milton,"This isn’t just a pusher like a lot of vehicles that they unveil or just vehicles that don’t actually function. . . . This is a fully functioning, you know, vehicle, which is really incredible. You can go through, you can, you know, we can change out pretty much everything we want, all the temperatures. I mean this is a fully functioning vehicle. It’s not just a not just a pusher. It’s what they call in the automotive world a vehicle that they just push and it doesn’t move. . . . "
stream,Trevor Milton,"We’re building out the hydrogen station right now globally. In America we’ve already got the largest hydrogen station in the western hemisphere at our headquarters. Can produce over 1,000 kilograms a day on site, we’re planning to expand that up to, up to essentially eight tons, which is about 8,000 kilograms a day. That’ll be done in Phoenix, Arizona. The station’s already up and operational for pumping right now. "
news,Trevor Milton,But one thing that’s really interesting about hydrogen is that you can create hundreds of megawatt hours of energy into hydrogen in times of the day where it would all be wasted anyways. And so it’s one of those – and energy is so cheap now that this is one point I’ve told people. If you pull energy out on your car in California you’re gonna pay – you can pay anywhere from 12 to 30 cents a kilowatt hour in California for energy. Depends on where you’re at. When I produce hydrogen I’m paying under 4 cents everywhere I go. And that’s because we’re doing it behind the grid in large quantities and that’s where people fill up. So what we’re able to do is really drive down the cost of energy. It might be less efficient; that’s true. But it’s actually cheaper per mile. (Emphasis added).
news,Trevor Milton,"Yeah, that’s, uh, that was a big problem we tackled. That’s why we came into the market. We saw an opportunity to bring the cost of hydrogen down going zero emission and putting it on parity or lower than diesel. And that’s the first time in history that’s been able to be done. So it went from about $16 a kilogram, we’re down now below $4 a kilogram and there’s lots of reasons for that. But the main one is standardization of a hydrogen station worldwide has allowed us to drive that cost down dramatically."
stream,Trevor Milton,"2nd major point. IPO. I am getting ready to go on a media blitz and the most critical item in our business model is that we don’t have stations. I would like to announce this on Monday as huge news. This will help our stock, create much stronger following and base layers of investors and it also will ease the criticism I am going to get going into interviews. I believe our PIPE and SPAC will be very happy to hear we are moving on our stations and not delaying.  "
twitter,Trevor Milton,"I love both BEV & Hydrogen. Here’s the breakdown to combat all the lies. A loaded truck w/full weight & average weather conditions. H2 is now under $4 per kg and working on sub $3 per kg. . . . 15 min full [sic] time & 10,000 lbs lighter . . . . Before anyone goes and slams me about cost of hydrogen, we don’t produce it in the city, we do it behind the meter at about $.04 / kWh on PPP clean energy. That’s why hydrogen makes sense for long haul. You’re not fighting utilities and rates."
podcast,Trevor Milton,"So the energy on the freeway, we, we, we tap directly into the main federal transmission lines and we contract directly with groups . . . an example would be like, you know, um, would be like a Tennessee Valley Authority. . . . So out on the freeways where the federal transmission lines are, and we can tap in, and we’ve, we’ve already preplanned all these, these locations where they can go. Um, and we’re gobbling up the best locations right now. "
podcast,Trevor Milton,"Soon I’ll be announcing when we’re going to show off the Badger to the whole world. And this thing is insanity. It is the most beautiful truck I think the world has ever seen. It’s a fully functioning vehicle inside and outside, HVAC, and everything, windows, all of it works. I shouldn’t say all of it – I’ll probably have a couple of pieces that’ll break on me, but hey, that’s part of the process of building the truck, but it’s a real real [sic] truck. It’s not just some mock up thing that other people have done. This is a real, real truck."
podcast,Trevor Milton,"So when we built all this technology, we had billions of dollars spent on the electrification platforms for our big trucks. I know I could take that money, all that technology that’s been built, and port it over to the most advanced pickup truck in the world. . . . Now, we’re going to use an existing OEM to build our Nikola Badgers. So we own all the tech. So all the cool stuff you guys want, the design, the inside, the connectivity with your phone . . . all the e-axles or, you know the electric motors, the batteries, the controls, all that’s done by Nikola. . . . "
podcast,Trevor Milton,"Yeah, the battery supply from the sale comes from GM, the cells and the module. The rest of the vehicle, like the over-air updating, the software, the controls, the infotainment, the design of the vehicle, the cab, the interior of the cab, even the, even the driver profile, we've been all the way down to suspension, that all comes from Nikola, with some support of GM’s integration team, but GM’s gonna handle the, they’ve already built a multi-billion dollar platform for their electric truck platform, so we’ve, we’ve took our technology and our existing Badger, we overlaid it on theirs, used what we could, implemented theirs, and then we built the rest around, um, around ours. So it’s probably 70 percent Nikola 30 percent GM when it comes to, um, the parts that are really important to us . . . . "
podcast,Trevor Milton,"Our margins are gigantic, and we have ten billion doll – ten – over ten billion dollars in preorder reservations like, like customers signed ready for us to deliver them trucks and it’s –  it’s just a great.  these are people who want to have -- what -- and why do those trucks – why do those shippers want to switch off diesel? Is it because of – they have goals in terms of greenhouse gases or is it they see this as the future and they wanna invest in it or is it cost?  No, real quick, I wanna correct something. Not letter of intents, they’re actually contracts. We’ve got –  Yeah, billions and billions of dollars with the contracts. So I want to be clear about that ‘cause a lot of people have thought that it’s just like, a non-committal thing, it’s not. These are like, sign on the dotted line, billions and billions and billions and billions of dollars in orders. Now, we have to deliver, and they can get out if we don’t d"
podcast,Trevor Milton,"Actually, as a matter of fact, you seen them increase. And I think they’re – which is really strange. At first I thought, oh, man, I wonder what this is going to do to – to – you know, to the – to everything. I had no idea. I don’t think anyone knew, right? And the orders actually came in – they’ve come in bigger and stronger, and we’ve had to turn a lot of people away. So for our hydrogen truck, we – we essentially have to pick and choose who we can work with because we’re sold out for so many years. "
podcast,Trevor Milton,"Once we got the technology nailed down, we actually have over 2,000 cycles on our battery, which would mean it would be more than a million-mile battery. It would actually – our battery beats the Tesla battery in every metric, in every situation, and it’s half the cost and it’s double the range. So, you know, for us, that was an exciting thing to be able to tell the world, and I actually appreciate the critics. I’m totally fine with it; I enjoy it. Because every time I prove them wrong, it drives them absolutely insane and they have to go back and admit they were wrong. For me, that’s the funnest part of it"
facebook,Trevor Milton," “the focus should be on the company and its world-changing mission, not me.”"
,,"  Yeah. Second biggest day of my life, I tell people, because the first day was when I got married, but the second day definitely was being listed on the Nasdaq. I mean, that’s everyone’s dream, to become listed on the Nasdaq and doing it through the coronavirus was actually incredible, because I’m a big believer in trying to find the good in all situations. And there was a lot of really difficult things going on around the world with the coronavirus, very sad. And so we turned Nikola into America’s comeback story, and that was a company that the world could rally behind that, they’d be proud. America would be proud, the world would be proud. The first zero emission semi-truck manufacturer in the entire world, to be dedicated only to zero emissions. And the investors have heavily rewarded us for it. Today, we’re at $53 a share or whatever, about $18 billion valuation in our company. And I mean, we’re going to be overtaking the biggest brands in the world here, shortly. And what a wonderful experience that has been, on all levels.   Oh, thanks. :  38. :  Yeah, 38.   No. :  Yeah. I have some really cool articles on my LinkedIn that I would recommend everyone go read. And I put some serious thought into those very heartfelt discussions about what it took to get here. And I’m going to tell you what those are right now, but I want people to know if they want to read in detail, they can go there. I’ve told everybody that I’ve ever met, that if you want to create wealth, it will not happen in under 10 years, ever. There are maybe one or two examples in the world that ever did happen quicker than that, unless you just got lucky, like some oil on your property or whatever it may be.  But ultimately if you’re going to create real wealth, it is a 10 year program and most likely, you’re going to fail, the odds are against you. So here’s what I tell people, “Look, if you want to be an entrepreneur and you want to do this, it is the most rewarding and invigorating thing on the planet Earth, when you succeed. It’s also the most difficult, emotional, draining venture you’ll ever do, when you fail. It’ll wreck you, it’ll wreck your body, your health, everything about you. So the risks are high, the rewards are high and the odds are, you’re going to fail.” Now, where people succeed is when they’ve got multiple failures and multiple successes underneath their belt.  So this is my fifth company. I’m 38, it’s my fifth company. Three of them have been successes and two have been failures. And it’s amazing, because you look online and some people are bashing me because they’re like, “Ah, I would never want this guy, this fraud, who’s failed twice in his life to touch my money.” And I’m like, “Well, you should definitely never invest in me or my company then, because I don’t know a single baseball player in the world that does not strike out when you’re hitting home runs.” The best baseball players in the world have a .400 batting average, right?   And so, 4 out of 10… I would never want anyone touching my money, if they haven’t failed. Because if you don’t know what it’s like to lose everything, then you’re going to make some really stupid decisions in your life. And so, these are just haters, just online haters that just hate you no matter what.   But to get here, that’s the beauty of this. It started out of my basement, truly because we didn’t know if we really had a product at that time. We worked out of there for a year. And here we are now, a $18 billion company, a couple days after the Nasdaq listing. So it’s pretty incredible.   It really was. It was a lot of, Trevor sitting down on his desk.   And creating these things. I mean, look, here’s the thing, I love communication. It’s one of my favorite things in life. I value communication as one of my greatest talents and assets I have. And that’s because you can communicate through all the craziness in the world. Like you said, there’s so many brands out there, how do you create a brand that is so special to the world? Well, in order to do that, you have to solve problems that are special to the world. And you’ll never stand out if you don’t change the world.  And in our mission statement, to leave this place a better place than we found it, I truly believe that. It’s my life goal, to leave this place better than I found it. And Nikola, if we pull this off, which I believe we have a very good chance of doing. If we pull this off, with getting all of our trucks built, all over the world, then you’re going to see the greatest reduction in emissions the world has ever seen, ever by any company on the planet. And so, that is why people are rewarding us. They’re rewarding us because we’re making a bigger change than anyone else is making.   Yeah, you’re purpose driven and then you actually have to be profitable. I think that’s why Nikola has done so well, is because our business model’s huge, our margins are… We make five times more revenue than Daimler does. Now just imagine that, per truck sold. So the reason why we’re successful is because we’ve vertically integrated the whole supply chain. So when you buy a diesel today, heaven forbid. You buy a diesel, you’re going to spend 150 on the diesel, right? 150,000.   Then, you’re going to spend a million dollars on the oil to power that diesel, over the life of it. So the oil companies are back there, just clapping their hands, loving every second that Peterbilt or Daimler sells a diesel truck. Because they make more revenue than Peterbilt or Daimler has ever dreamed of making.   So that’s where I was like, “Dude, this is crazy. Why are we not sucking all that money out of the oil company’s hands and putting it in our own pocket?” And that’s what I did. I said, “Okay, we’re going to sell the truck, but we’re going to provide all the fuel at a fixed rate for seven years.” And now, we’ve stabilized the cost of hydrogen, driven it down low, made it towards cheaper, that it can be cheaper than diesel. And we’re taking that 750,000 to $1,000,000 in revenue, in oil and we’re bringing it into our own pockets. Because we’re not doing oil, we’re doing hydrogen. And so we make five times more revenue, on every truck we sell, we get about a million dollars in revenue. So that’s why Nikola has done so well.   Oh man, the Volkswagen emissions scandal was like, I hate to ever take advantage of a bad situation, right? But I mean, it was the greatest thing for Nikola that’s ever happened because the jackasses- :  … they lied to the whole world, they deceived everyone. People realized that they were cheaters and the world has now rewarded Tesla and Nikola for both pioneering zero emission around the world. But that’s a whole different thing. Why is it built in Ulm? Well, let me break this out real quick. We have two factories. We have one going up in Coolidge Arizona, which is part of Phoenix Arizona. And we have one factory going up in Ulm Germany, right now. And Ulm is spelled U-L-M for all the Americans that don’t know how to say Ulm.  So the reason why we have Ulm Germany, is because our partner IVECO, we did a massive joint venture with IVECO and this joint venture is going to provide all the battery-electric and hydrogen-electric trucks to all of Europe. So right now, we were the first company to launch the zero-emission truck, we’re the first company to do full production of a zero-emission truck. We were first and that’s one of the greatest things out there. And it’s a full production truck, over 300 miles. There are other people that have the little rinky-dink trucks that go like 150 miles, but I’m talking full 300 miles, pulling a real load.  So we’re the first company in the world to do it. They’re coming out of Ulm Germany. In just a matter of, I would say less than a few months, we’ll have the first ones coming out that are hand-built. And by middle to third quarter of next year, full production begins, out of that factory. So in the same time we’re building our American factory for our American trucks, we’re going to provide both the battery-electric and the hydrogen as well, but they’re built to go longer distances, 500 plus miles. So that’s kind of how everything’s going right now is, yes, we did beat everybody. We beat Daimler, we beat Volvo, we beat Tesla, we beat everybody. And it’s a wonderful feeling to be able to do that.   It is. The Badger’s this badass pickup truck. Well, let’s just put it this way, the reason why people have not been a fan of electric pickup trucks is because they can’t do what a gasoline can do, right? So even with the Cybertruck from Tesla or the Rivian truck, they’re very small, they don’t go very far. They can’t pull a trailer up a 6% grade. They can’t handle the continuous load that you can put on a gasoline vehicle. So that’s always been the biggest hinderment to a electric truck, was people want a truck that can actually pull a trailer. They can take it to a construction site, they can drive around with their family, they can pull a boat with it or whatever.    And so we built that. We built the most gorgeous, badass electric, hydrogen pickup truck in the world. And what sets it apart from everything, is that you can order the Badger as a battery-electric truck, that’ll give you 3 to 400 miles on its own. And you can also order the Badger as a battery-electric and hydrogen truck, which will give you 600 plus miles on a range. :   So the customer can fully spec it, how they want it. And everyone else is like either, “Oh, you’ll only get battery.” Well, some people need the continuous horsepower or the additional range that hydrogen gives you. And so, you can order either way with a Badger and we’re the only ones in the world that offer that.   Yeah. It’s a very pissed off truck and you have to be careful because it’ll come off the ground. So we’re having a lot of fun with it. And the best part is here, just in a few days, on June 29th, we’re going to start accepting reservations of that. And we’re going to show the real truck off here, at the end of this year, at Nikola World 2020. And I’m not talking about some show truck, I’m talking about a metal stamped, beautiful, gorgeous, fully-functioning interior, exterior, power windows, power seats, HVAC, just awesome truck. Every other person out there building trucks, half the features don’t even work, because they’re just show trucks. This is the real thing.   So design is everything. I mean, listen, the reason why Apple is Apple, is because they have the greatest designs known to man. Their packaging is incredible, their experience is incredible and their product is stunning. And people don’t get this. I mean, it’s unbelievable how the automakers make the most ugly-ass vehicles you’ve ever seen and they expect them to sell. Nikola is, if you were to ever compare it to anything, the gorgeousness of what Apple does with their design and their products is very similar to what Nikola does. Every one of our products, you should see the battles that go on here at Nikola, with the design team and me.  If people had a… If they were a fly on the wall, just the stories told would be funny because I come into my design studio and I’ll tell my guys, I’m like, “Guys, I won’t buy that. That’s hideous. And I’ll never allow that to be sold. You’re going to fix that. And it’s got to be something, if it will not sell me, no one will buy it.” And it’s brutal. You get in, sometimes you have to throw a whole vehicle away because you’re like, “It just doesn’t work. Nothing works. It doesn’t work.” And so the Nikola Badger, is probably the most gorgeous truck that’s ever been built, in history, in my opinion. And a lot of people agree with that. And that’s how all of our product lines are, even our big semi-truck, the Nikola Tre and the Nikola Two, worldwide they’re known as the most beautiful semi-trucks ever designed. And imagine that, an American trying to build a European cabover, that’s gorgeous. :  The Europeans can’t even do that sometimes.   Well look, this is the thing about truck owners. I’ll mention them, the people that are going to buy the Tesla Cybertruck are going to be Tesla fanatics. You’re going to get a few people outside that are going to buy it, but it doesn’t function as a real truck. It doesn’t have the features of a real truck. Now, it’s cool, when it comes to like, it’s pushing the limits, but it’s not a real truck. It doesn’t have the visibility you get in a truck. It doesn’t have the bed that you get in a truck. It doesn’t have the ability to put a fifth wheel on it. A real truck needs to do what real trucks do. And so, we had to build a truck that was gorgeous, yet would function as a real truck. And we partnered up with, actually awesome, the Diesel Brothers. And it’s really cool because the Diesel Brothers are known as building diesel trucks, right? They can break any truck ever built, they know how to modify every truck known to man and they know what parts fail.  So it was interesting, because we got a lot of questions that said, “Why’d you partner up with Diesel Brothers? They do diesel, you guys are all about zero emission.” And I’m like, “Yeah, but the Diesel Brothers, they don’t stick their head in the sand and say, ‘Oh, only diesel’s ever going to function.’ They came out and they said, ‘Look, it is time now, the world’s changing. And we want to be part of the greatest transformation of trucking engineering known to man. And it’s going away from diesel right now, it’s going to electric mobility.'” So we worked with the Diesel Brothers and they’ve really helped us build this pickup truck, to become a pickup truck that would never fail. And believe me, we’re going to have failures, but we got the teams behind us to make sure that this truck is designed as a real truck. :  Yes, this one really bothers me because I preach to people about how important it is to find people that are better than you, to work with. And to work with people that do things better than the things that you’re not great at. And I went on this podcast and I got hammered by a lot of my competitors’ fans. Because they’re like, “Oh, Nikola doesn’t do shit themselves. They outsource everything.” No, that’s not true. We do all the really important stuff, like intellectual property controls, software, hardware development, everything else, we do all that. But what we are not good at is building factories, right? And so these guys hammered us. I mean, all their followers, like tens of thousands are like, “Ah, Nikola’s a total con job because they don’t build their own factory. These guys are not Tesla.”  And I’m like, “Do you realize how many billions of dollars have been wasted by Tesla, because they didn’t work with someone that knew how to build factories and do them…” I’m a big believer in working with people that are better than you. And so, I don’t need to be so arrogant to say that I’m better than everyone at everything. I don’t need to be better than everyone at everything. I need to be better than my competitors at one thing and I can beat them. And so, I think that’s what we do is we’re really good at partnerships. We’re going to be signing a joint venture for the Nikola Badger with a big OEM and it’s going to be sold, serviced, and warrantied through their dealership, all across America. And I get access to that, day one. I don’t need to go out and spend $5 billion building our own service network.  So I’m a big believer in partnerships. :  Yeah. I mean, look, so it was named after the Serbian-Croatian brilliant mastermind that probably had a greater impact on society than anyone else in the world. He created the alternative current, the generator, the turbine, all kinds of things. This guy was the most brilliant electrical engineer known to man. He could power vehicles wirelessly. He could power homes wirelessly from miles away. Even today, we still don’t know how he did it all.  It was named after the inventor, Nikola Tesla, and it had nothing to do with Elon or Tesla themselves. They didn’t even enter my mind when I was making this decision because I was naming it after the inventor. And just like millions of other people that looked up to that inventor, it’s to pay tribute to him. Has nothing to do with the Tesla car company at all. It’s just cool that Tesla is making one of the biggest impacts in the world for electric mobility in cars. And Nikola is making one of the biggest impacts in the world for Electromobility in trucks. And so, it is kind of cool to think about that, the fact that Nikola and Tesla are both kicking ass and beating everyone around the world. :  The name was taken already and the guy had no interest in selling it. So he may sell it one day, it’s becoming more and more valuable. I’m sure he’ll sell it to someone, it’ll probably be someone who hates us and trashes us. :  No. Yeah. I mean look, everyone knows it’s Nikola Motor. And when they look us up, it’s already well established that way. We can see how many people actually type in our name and the wrong name and we might get 1% more that actually go to the right name. I don’t care about the domain, it all comes down to the fact that it’s Nikola Motor. It’s not Nikola, it’s Nikola Motor. So I don’t know, who knows? If he ever wants to sell it, we talked but he had no desire to, and I’m sure our competitors will probably offer him some stupid amount of money and buy it.   I’ll give him one of the first Badgers, one of the most valuable thing. He’ll love that.:  No, it was actually from day one. The N, it was from day one and it was made to be almost like a superhero logo. So if you were to look at Superman or you were at one of the other ones, you’ll notice that it’s one letter and usually circled by something. And that’s why we went with the Nikola, that’s why we designed that was, it’s an N with a border around it. And what that does is, you can see it from a mile away and you’ll know it’s Nikola. It’s so distinguishable that nothing ever will confuse it. And that was the idea is, it truly is a superhero. And that’s what’s cool about it. You’ll see it from a mile away and everyone will know it’s a Nikola, playing that game in their car, with all their children. :  I’d say there’s three or four main pillars of building a company that will last forever and actually make money. Branding and design is one of them. Your team is another one, your team. And then your ability to communicate is one of the four pillars. There’s a ton of them, right? But the idea is, your ability to communicate, which is part of branding. Branding and design is everything. People, they want to touch your product, they want to be proud of it. And they’re not going to go drop 60 to $100,000 on a pickup truck if they don’t think it’s the most gorgeous thing that they’ve ever seen. And people have got to learn, branding and design is everything.  It’s one reason why I love Audi. Look, there is no better design company, I think in the world than Audi itself. Their team has got their shit down so good, when it comes to branding and design. It’s probably the only thing that saved Volkswagen. And that’s why you got to be an expert at branding and design. It’s everything, it speaks to someone’s soul. People have to be proud of representing what you have and that’s why the branding and design’s so important.  No.   It would be hard to put it on one word, but I’d say it’s something along the lines of emissions, game over. :  Everything we stand for, is getting rid of emissions and diesel is dead. It’s everything around transformation. I would say probably transformation is really our… Because it transforms everything. It transforms, design, style, the culture, emissions. So if it had to be one word, probably transformation. :  No, there’s two articles they need to go read. They’re more powerful than anything I can say today, because I laid out with written words and they can study it. There’s two articles. One’s called A random airport encounter. And the other one’s called How to get back up when you’ve lost everything. These two articles are the most powerful articles you’ll ever read, in my opinion, as an entrepreneur ever. They’re coming from the most painful position I’ve ever felt in my life, losing everything. It comes from a position of love and happiness and hope and explaining to people what it means to not give up. Everyone fails and you’re going to fail hard. And the key is to never, ever quit, no matter how hard or how long it is, you can never, ever give up.  And those articles are incredible because they go into detail. The airport one’s about a kid who I met in the airport asking me, how he was going to college and he was thinking about becoming an entrepreneur and what advice I had for him. And I gave him a quick five minute thing in the airport. He had no idea who I was either, by the way, he had no clue.   I was just talking to this kid. And then later he found out who I was and he sent me an email. And I gave him this written letter back and I posted this letter I gave him. And it’s me writing to this kid. And I’m telling you, it’s one of the most powerful letters you’ll ever read. And I hope it’s taught in every business school in the world because it’s not like any letter you’ll ever read. It’s not written by a professor, it’s written by pain. It’s written by absolute failure and everything I learned in these situations. And then it’s also written by hope, about how to get out of it.  And that’s a real life experience, of this shit storm you’re going to go through to build your own company and ever get listed, is you better be ready to have battle wounds and scars all over your body and you better be ready to dedicate 10 years, or you’re going to fail. And you’re probably going to fail anyways. But then these are ways you can actually get back up and keep going. And eventually, like Mark Cuban says, all you got to do is hit it once. All you got to do is hit a home run one time, that’s it and they’ll love you, just do it once. It doesn’t matter if it takes you five times, all you got to do is do at once.  Say that again, I’m sorry. What were you asking?   What do you mean by brand fail? I haven’t used that terminology here. What do you mean by brand fail?   Well, luckily we haven’t had too many of those moments, because of a lot of the experiences I’ve had, but I’ll tell you the one that made the biggest difference. When we first started out, there was no technology and fuel cell or battery electric yet. It was very, very new. And so we started out as a turbine electric, natural gas, hybrid truck. And that was the only technology available at the time. And that was pushing the limits. And I went to my board and I said, “Guys, the technology fuel cell is now far enough along and batteries, we have to pivot from this low-emission turbine to a fuel cell.” And my board shit a brick. Like, “There’s no way, we’re already far down this road. We can’t just pivot.” And I said, “You don’t know me. I don’t care what the repercussions are.”  And this is something I teach in that letter, when you have a conviction of something, you better listen to yourself. And I said, “It’s time to change, and I change it.” And they freaked out. I mean, it was almost relationship severing, right? And sure enough, it was the biggest, greatest, smartest move we ever did, going zero emission. Once that technology was far enough along, we could pioneer it. And man, what an impact it made. And it’s a single reason why we’re here today. So to all the entrepreneurs out there, you better believe in yourself, and if you do, stand by your convictions, no matter what anyone tells you. You’re the only one qualified to make those decisions. Don’t listen to the people around you, make your own decisions.   They can go to nikolamotor.com, that’s where all of our products are.

The way you came from behind, somebody who wasn't given much of a chance, and you ended up winning easily. It's a fantastic achievement. Congratulations.  That's a very good idea. I think your country is very happy about that. : Well it is very nice of you to say that. I will say that we do a lot for Ukraine. We spend a lot of effort and a lot of time. Much more than the European countries are doing and they should be helping you more than they are. Germany does almost nothing for you. All they do is talk and I think it's something that you should really ask them about. When I was speaking to Angela Merkel she talks Ukraine, but she ·doesn't do anything. A lot of the European countries are the same way so I think it's something you want to look at but the United States has been very very good to Ukraine. I wouldn't say that it's reciprocal necessarily because things are happening that are not good but the United States has been very very good to Ukraine.  I would like you to do us a favor though because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it. I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say Crowdstrike... I guess you have one of your wealthy people... The server, they say Ukraine has it. There are a lot of things that went on, the whole situation. I think you're surrounding yourself with some of the same people. I would like to have the Attorney General call you or your people and I would like you to get to the bottom of it. As you saw yesterday, that whole nonsense ended with a very poor performance by a man named Robert Mueller, an incompetent performance, but they say a lot of it started with Ukraine. Whatever you can do, it's very important that you do it if that's possible.  Good because I heard you had a prosecutor who was very good and he was shut down and that's really unfair. A lot of people are talking about that, the way they shut your very good prosecutor down and you had some very bad people involved. Mr. Giuliani is a highly respected man. He was the mayor of New York City, a great mayor, and I would like him to call you. I will ask him to call you along with the Attorney General. Rudy very much knows what's happening and he is a very capable guy. If you could speak to him that would be great. The former ambassador from the United States, the woman, was bad news and the people she was dealing with in the Ukraine were bad news so I just want to let you know that. The other thing, There's a lot of talk about Biden's son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it... It sounds horrible to me.  Well, she's going to go through some things. I will have Mr. Giuliani give you a call and I am also going to have Attorney General Barr call and we will get to the bottom of it. I'm sure you will figure it out. I heard the prosecutor was treated very badly and he was a very fair prosecutor so good luck with everything. Your economy is going to get better and better I predict. You have a lot of assets. It's a great country. I have many Ukrainian friends, their incredible people.  Good. Well, thank you very much and I appreciate that. I will tell Rudy and Attorney General Barr to call. Thank you. Whenever you would like to come to the White House, feel free to call. Give us a date and we'll work that out. I look forward to seeing you.  Okay, we can work that out. I look forward to seeing you in Washington and maybe in Poland because I think we are going to be there at that time. Congratulations on a fantastic job you've done. The whole world was watching. I'm not sure it was so much of an upset but congratulations."
news,Donald Trump,"— It has to be that way — I have been very strong on that. [President asks to go off-the-record] [to an aide] I’m talking about through the Straits. The oil that comes in by country. I had it yesterday. Who would have it? Maybe Bolton would have it, or somebody 120,000 people have requested tickets. We have the big Orlando Basketball Arena, with the floor, it holds 25,000 people. It sold out in the first day. It sold out in the first hour. And we have 120,000 people. I went to Texas to help Ted Cruz. We had 106,000 people. We had to take ads asking people not to come. Tomorrow, what we did is we put big screens up, television screens because the arena is so — these are big arenas. This is the size of Madison Square Garden. I think it’s slightly larger. It’s where the Orlando Magic plays. It is packed. We’ll have thousands and thousands of people outside. O.K., that’s one. And that’s despite the — no, that’s right. That’s despite. We’re taking some from the military. We’re taking some from the drug enforcement. We’re taking — we have different pockets where we’re taking it. And we will have over 450 miles built by the end of next year. We’re also renovating tremendous amounts of wall. We’re renovating and fixing. We’re putting — areas that didn’t have wall, we’re putting temporary walls in. We’re doing a great job, and the job we did with Mexico, nobody could even believe. Anyway, thank you all very much. Bad coverage, though. I should get good coverage. I built one of the strongest economies, I built probably the strongest economy, certainly one of them, but the strongest. I mean you could go by many — go by unemployment. African Americans, Asians, Hispanics, the strongest they’ve ever had. More people working today, almost 160 million. By far more than we’ve ever had working. You know, you could make the case, this is the greatest economy we’ve ever had. I built that. If Hillary would have gotten in, it would have been decimated. Instead of being at 3.2, we’d be at minus-5 or minus-6. It was going bad. If you look at the numbers from the end of the Obama, it was crashing. It was crashing. And here’s the good news. We have tremendous potential. Maybe it depends to a certain extent on what happens with some trade deals, but we’ve already done the deal with North Korea. It’s totally done, it’s really good. I took a bad deal, I terminated it, and I made it a good deal. Got the 25% on trucks, on small trucks, et cetera, et cetera, which was terminated. Which is frankly very interesting. You ought to look at this sometime. The Chicken Tax. It’s the most successful vehicle built in the automobile industry in America today. I was able to do it. But we did the deal — KORUS —you know, the deal with North Korea — the deal with South Korea. We did pretty much everything I’ve set out to do is either done or on its way to being done. Now, when you look at that list, and you go point by point by point by point, you say does this gentleman ever take it easy? Because they’re trying to come in because the economy is so good. We have 3.5% unemployment. The economy is — you could make the case it’s never been stronger than it is now, and the people are trying to come up for the economy. They’re not coming up for asylum. They’re coming up for money. But here you have nothing. The caliphate is gone. This doesn’t mean you don’t have crazy people around that, you know? And bombs — I’m not saying any fighting is finished because with these people, you never know. They’re totally — they’re stone-cold crazy. But there’s ISIS. There it is a year later. And there it is now. Not bad. Not bad. Not bad — But they will be. Look, we’ve gotten remains back. That will start up again. We have gotten our prisoners back. We had four prisoners, got them back. confidentially, I didn’t give it to you to take photographs of it — So don’t play that game with me. Let me just tell you something. You take a look — Do I bet? Do you want something to drink, folks? Even look at the First Quarter, we’re at 3.2%. Nobody expected that. They thought it would be one — you know, the First Quarter is always very low. We’re at 3.2%. The economy is so strong that people are coming up. Now what I did with Mexico is, Mexico — I don’t know if you’ve seen, but the numbers are way down since they started last week, and they haven’t even — they’re putting their — they’re starting to move the 6,000 soldiers in tomorrow. Excuse me — Excuse me — Excuse me — Under Section II — Well, you can go to prison instead, because, if you use, if you use the photograph you took of the letter that I gave you — Go ahead. Have you seen this? No, seriously. Here’s a letter, O.K., now I’m going to show you this letter. So this was written by Kim Jong-un. It was delivered to me yesterday. By hand. I — I’m — I have the exceptions, and I’ve always been for the exceptions, and I think that’s very important. I agree with that. I don’t think — I think I’m getting credit, but I’m not getting the full credit. If the Democrats had won the 2016 race, instead of being up 3.1%, I think it would be down 5%. I think we would actually be down because what — what I — I had the largest cut in regulations in the history of the country. In two years, I cut more regulations than any other President, no matter how long their term was. That was a big factor in terms of what’s happened with the country, with the thing. With the whole — with the whole success that we’ve had. If the Democrats got in, they wouldn’t have done that and they would have put more regulation on, and you would have been in — you would have seen a real mess. Here’s that. Do you see what I’m saying with that letter? It’s pretty good, right? I mean this is pretty good. I could have told Sessions myself if I wanted to. Under Section II — I didn’t limit the investigation. I don’t know, I don’t like it, I don’t like the concept of separation. I’d rather keep them from coming up, it would be a lot easier because I don’t like it. But I’m — it’s crazy. I got such a bad rap on that. I inherited separation. I don’t think they — I don’t think they did that. And frankly, I could have ended that — Mueller — immediately under Article II, if I wanted to. Article II, we don’t even talk about Article II because there’s no reason to talk about it. But I could have ended Mueller immediately. I could have done that, I decided not to do that. I had the power to do it if I wanted to do it. So there has never been a President that’s been as transparent as I’ve been. 1.5 million pages of documents. I gave… 300 or 500 people, testified. I allowed many people, including White House counsel, to testify. Hundreds of subpoenas, in fact, I think thousands of subpoenas I said — I didn’t exert presidential prerogative. I didn’t use presidential prerogative in any way, shape or form. I don’t think they did that — I don’t think they will continue to grow. I think they’re starting to go down now. I have a base that’s a phenomenal — it’s just a phenomenal base. It’s a very loyal base and I’m loyal to them also. With that being said, the thing that I have that’s different, because based on the economy, I should be up 15 or 20 points higher. It should be, just based on the economy. You know it’s the economy, stupid, right? Based on the economy, I should be at much higher numbers than I am. And the thing that I have that nobody’s ever had before, from the day I came down the escalator, I have had a phony witch hunt against me. And not long after that day, you understand, from the day and you look at the insurance policy by crooked FBI agents, where they talked about the insurance policy just in case Hillary Clinton should lose. The insurance policy. We lived the insurance policy, if that’s what it was. I hope you’re going to write it. Do you want to keep them? Can we give them? I inherited separation. I just don’t feel it. I know. But I would be surprised if it’s not China, and if it’s not other countries. I think it’s much more — I think it’s cost me — yeah, and it’s phony, and I think that will turn around because it’s been proven to be phony. The whole thing. Impeachment. Impeachment for what? Nothing was done wrong. Impeachment for what?! There was no collusion, nothing was done wrong. You know there are those that say — Alan Dershowitz wrote a piece the other day that it’s illegal to impeach him. There’s nothing done wrong, you can’t impeach I wouldn’t say that. I can’t say that at all. It would be inappropriate. But they would be making a big mistake if they enriched. I’d love to broaden it. I think I have one of the greatest — you know there are those who say I have the greatest base in the history of American politics because it always stays at 45, 46, 47. I mean it’s been — today it’s at 51. Wasn’t Rasmussen 51? 51. And I’ll tell you, you know, Rasmussen — you know — it’s respected — they got the election the best. That’s why I say Rasmussen because they got the election the most right. Los Angeles Times, Rasmussen, and I think it was Business Insider, believe it or not, three polls got it very good. But Rasmussen was good. That’s at 51%. But I have a base of 45, 46% that is a phenomenal base. In 13 years — It might. I mean a lot of people say it would. Most people say it would. I don’t know, I really don’t know. But I think it’s inappropriate, when somebody wins — The only thing I did wrong was winning an election. By winning an election, I made them so angry. I’ll tell you what, winning an election and building a great economy — and by the way, doing all those things on the pages that I gave you. Let me tell you this. I could have ended the whole thing very quickly. Very easily. I said let it play out, and the bottom line was no collusion, and subject to a review of the documents, no obstruction by the Attorney General. After he reviewed the documents, he found no obstruction. That result has driven the Democrats crazy, crazy. These people have gone absolutely insane. Look — when I first — One of the first meetings I had was with the Pentagon, and we were talking about the Middle East, which I was always against going in. You know people always like to say, “Oh, maybe he was too —” I wasn’t. I was always, I was against going into Iraq. It was a terrible… going into the Middle East was a terrible decision. We’re into the Middle East for $7 trillion. Many lives, and if you look at both sides, you know, unbelievable numbers of lives — because I look at both sides, I don’t just look at the one side. I look at both sides. It was a terrible decision to go in. It’s quicksand. Always has been, always will be. And we’re doing just fine. We did ISIS. We’re doing fine in terms of Afghanistan. We’re down to half — we’ll soon be down to about 8,000 soldiers. Look at when they were signing the agreement, they were all screaming death to America as they’re signing the agreement? What’s that all about? They picked up the seven sailors, and the only reason the sailors — the 10 sailors — the only reason the sailors were let go is that we started making massive payments to them the following day. Otherwise the sailors would still be there under President Obama. Look, I’m building a wall despite the fact that the Democrats don’t want a wall built. They have fought every — we just won a lawsuit on the wall. I don’t know if you saw that, a big one, a very important one, against Nancy Pelosi in the House. They sued us, and we won a lawsuit last week, a very big one. We’re building a wall, the wall is going up as we speak. We’ve already renovated vast amounts of wall, taking inferior product and making it very good, very strong. We had walls, we built walls in San Diego. Look, if this was reversed, where the Republicans did this to a Democrat, every one of them would be in jail for years already. O.K.? If they did — if this was reversed, where I did to them what they did to me, the repercussions would be enormous. The press is protecting the DNC, the Democrats, crooked Hillary. They’re totally protected by the press. They’re partners, let’s face it. They’re partners. Look at TIME Magazine. I read a couple of stories in TIME Magazine that were so bad, it was unbelievable. It was unbelievable. Many of those records were Obama records, and they had separation and they had the exact same thing during the Obama years. The difference is because our economy is so strong, more people came up. Plus, they learned how weak our laws are. Now the laws, hopefully, are going to be changed. But they learned how weak the laws are. But you know, if Mexico does the job, they have very strong policy; they have very strong immigration policy. If Mexico does the job, there should be very few people coming up through Mexico. And Mexico can do the job. And I believe they will do the job, but if they don’t do the job, we’re going to put tariffs on, and they understand that, and the tariffs are very significant. My whole life is a bet. No, and he also … excuse me … what did he say? He said, in fact, there was pushback. He said they pushed back. Our staff pushed back. No, but you understand what I’m saying. No, I don’t think we have any problems. I have a good group of people now. I have people that I want. And we have some terrific people, and no, that’s not a problem. But what is a problem is that the United States takes care of the world, and the world doesn’t take care of the world. The world doesn’t want to take care of itself. There are some countries, as an example that benefit greatly, and they’re rich countries. These are very rich countries in some cases, and they don’t make contributions, and they haven’t for many, many years. And at some point — you know, look, I’ve done a lot about that. If you look at NATO, if you call up Secretary General Stoltenberg, you’ll see that, he said over $100 billion has been contributed over the last very short period of time by other countries who were not living up to their 2% commitment and the 2% should be more than 2%, by the way. And over $100 billion has been paid, and if you look at a chart of NATO, it’s gone, go back 15 years, it’s gone literally, the contribution, down here, and then it went up like this when I became — And I told them, I said, ‘Look, the United States cannot continue to be—’ I mean, they’re not paying. They’re literally not paying. We’re protecting nations, and they’re not paying, and it was very unfair. But Secretary General Stoltenberg was terrific. He tells it like it is. Big difference. No, I don’t want to provide you details, there’s no reason to. What difference, you won’t write it the way it’s proper anyway. But I had a nasty business dispute with Comey. And you know the other disputes, also we had. And he sat, see that chair you’re in? He was right in that chair, wanting the job to be the FBI Director, and I said no. O.K.? That’s a conflict of interest. Despite that, he said no collusion. First chapter. No collusion. No conspiracy. Push back. Push back. So now they have a phony crime and they say I tried to obstruct a phony crime. But you see, but I didn’t. I didn’t. And more importantly, under Article II, I could have done whatever I wanted. I could have fired Mueller if I wanted, but I didn’t, because if anybody checked out Richard Nixon, that didn’t work out so well. Alright? But I could have — I could have fired — I had the right under Article II to fire Robert, but I didn’t. And I didn’t want to. I figured, let him finish his report. Let’s see. The report came out, no collusion. Collusion being the biggest thing, meaning conspiracy. Or whatever they want to call it. And the report was very clear on that. And remember, take a look — there was actually in fact push back, do you agree with that, Sarah? They actually had push back from our people. Not only didn’t they accept, but there was push back. And then Phase two, they set up a crime. What about Hillary Clinton’s 33,000 emails? What about the fact that she paid Christopher Steele for a fake phony dossier — tremendous amounts of money — her and the DNC. If you guys wrote the real story, you’d end up doing very well. You’d end up with Pulitzer Prizes. I’ll tell you there are people that should get Pulitzer Prizes, but they aren’t the ones that got ’em. The ones that got ’em should hand ’em back because they called this thing very wrong. No, I don’t. I think I’m good. I think they’re vulnerable. No, I think the Democrats are totally vulnerable. I think we’re doing a great job on immigration. No, I think it’s turned out to be an asset because it’s really energized our base, like I’ve never seen before. No, I would view it differently. I would view the Iran situation differently. I think that things could have happened, that Iran would have been a much different country today. When I took over Iran — when I took over as President, when I became President and then took over Jan. 20, Iran was a much different country 2-1/2 years ago. They were unbelievably hostile. They were truly a nation of terror. They were all over the place. We had 14 points of confliction, and they were behind every single one of them. Now it’s a different country. They have tremendous problems, problems that nobody would have ever thought they had. And that was not a time to make the deal, the deal that President Obama made. That was a horrible deal. So I terminated that deal, did other things including sanctions, and Iran wants to make a deal also. I will tell you right now. They don’t talk [about] it, although sometimes they do. But Iran wants to make a deal, and it’s the smartest thing they could do, is to make a deal. No, no, I’m not going to make it bad. I’m just saying it wasn’t good. The economy wasn’t very good, and it was weak under President Obama. Now it’s the strongest economy we’ve probably ever had. No, no, no — he said there was pushback. No, no, we fixed walls, and in some cases, we have added massive amounts of barbed wire because the walls were not effective the way they were. And we used the walls as a structure for the barbed wire, and now that the barbed wire is up, nobody is coming across. They can’t come across. The walls have become very effective, and they were very ineffective before. You could climb them, you can’t climb them now. But we’re also building large numbers of new wall. If you want, I can get the Army Corps of Engineers to tell you exactly what we’re building, but we’re building — we will have over 400 miles of wall built by the end of next year. No, we’ll have — we’ll have, over 400, We’re building the wall right now. People don’t understand. We are building the wall right now. It is under major construction. No. Europe looks at me as a double — I guess first of all, my relationships with Europe are very good. You saw that with my recent trip to — number of trips, frankly — but my recent trip with France, where Normandy was a tremendous and beautiful thing to behold. It really was incredible. But I have very good relationships in Europe. The Prime Minister of U.K., the Queen of England — we had a great time. We had a great time. We have very good relationships in Europe. I would say our relationships are far better now than under the Obama Administration, but they respect us more because they got away with things that were very unfair. Like as an example, Europe, the European nations, if you look at what’s happening on trade. O.K., it was really unfair what’s been happening on trade. They, we lost, over the years, on average, $150 billion a year on trade with the European — as a group — the European nations. It’s very unfair. Then on top of it, we protect them, from NATO, in the form of NATO. And NATO, if you take a look at it, NATO probably, a lot of people would dispute this number, but we were paying 70 to 80% of NATO. That’s unfair. No. French. Is there like a French name? No. Good. Thank you. North Korea? O.K., here — I ended separation — which Obama had, which Bush, which everybody had. I ended separation. One thing. But the biggest thing is the economy is so strong, and the Democrats — the only reason we have this is because the Democrats won’t fix the loopholes. The loopholes are terrible, and they won’t fix asylum. We could have them fixed in 15 minutes, but they refused to fix it. The only reason we have a problem at the border — and with that problem comes the fact that people learned about their legal rights on the border — the Democrats could fix the asylum problem and the loophole problem in 15 minutes. If they did that, everything would immediately stop. The border would be 100% secure. Now, when you add Mexico to it, and then you fix — then you really have a great secure situation. But I think Mexico will solve most of the problem by itself. But the Democrats have to fix these asylum problems. I mean we have asylum — we have an asylum situation that is so ridiculous. We’re the only country in the world with the things that we have to do, and the Democrats could easily fix it, but they want open borders — which means crimes, it means drugs. Oh, do you come out on Thursday? Oh, we do — well, we’ve done things that Obama didn’t do. When the FBI went to Obama in September, and they told him about this, he did nothing because he thought Hillary Clinton was going to win, and he didn’t want to rock the boat. OK. On obstruction. You mean on a no-crime. You mean there was no crime. So there was no crime taken and — President Obama in September was told by the FBI about Russia. He did nothing. Hillary Clinton went out and paid a man who went to Russia and used Russians and paid Russians. They did nothing. A lot of the bloggers that you read about, O.K.? You read about these bloggers. They were on Hillary’s side and Trump’s side. The so-called — was it 24 numerous — And you’re talking about — she spent hundreds of millions of dollars on advertising and Facebook and everything else. Right, right — Short-range, extremely short-range. And no different than anyone else tests and launches, et cetera. Can I have that letter back you have? So let me tell you about that. It’s very interesting. President Obama had separation. I’m the one that brought it together. I was the one, and what that did is it made more people come up because I didn’t like separation any more than you did. But if you look at those cells, where they were showing all these cells, they looked like jail cells or cyclone fence — but they look like jail cells. They were built in 2014 by Obama. I think you people had one of those pictures actually. You said look at these cells. It turned out they were built by Obama. They were built by people that I know very well. People that want to come into the Administration. But if you look at the separation policy, I had that policy, and then I’m the one that put the families back together. When you put the families back together, you have more families come up. It’s a very simple … So we’re rebuilding the military, which is creating jobs. We’re doing some really good things in health care. We’re doing some tremendous things in health care. You see what’s happening with some of the policies that we’re coming out with. We got rid of, as I said, we got rid of the individual mandate, which was by far the most popular thing in Obamacare. We’re managing Obamacare much better. But Obamacare is a very — it’s very bad. And if we win, I will do healthcare. If we get the House. If we get back the House — you can’t do it without the House. Sure. I am. We all have our meetings. But I generally do my own thing. Like for instance, they had the Stephanopoulos interview, and I said, you know, let me watch this, and then it said both things — did you see that? Where I said, yeah, I’d do both. Thank you. That might happen. No. It might happen. But I think my base is so strong, I’m not sure that I have to do that. But I’d like to do it, just as President, I’d like to do it. Not for political reasons. I’d like to do it as President. The Russian hoax that they’ve put us through has hurt our country, and it’s made our country much more divided than it should have been. If I didn’t have that situation happen, which is totally — and by the way, now we’ve been exonerated by the Mueller Report. Again, these are people that hated Donald Trump. How do you pick all people who are opposed to me? And I still got a great report. Had we not had that, the country would have been much more united than it is. That was a very bad thing for the country. What they did with the phony witch hunt was a very bad thing, and it’s bad now, what they’re doing. You know, when they try to keep — They want a do-over. The Mueller Report was a disaster for the Democrats. They want a do-over. That would be pretty impressive. I assume you want them; I assume you’re going to put that in your front page. So this is ISIS — That’s all right, let them have it. If we do, maybe I’ll get my first good cover of TIME since I got elected. The first story was great. The first story, when I won the election, that was written by a gentleman with like a French name. That’s pretty new. Here’s a list of the things, each spot, each line is another thing. Nobody has done this. These are all between bills and things. I’d like you to keep it. Take a look. That’s true. Well I have. We defeated ISIS, the caliphate. We’ve taken back the caliphate. That doesn’t mean one of the crazies doesn’t walk into a store all bombed up. But we’ve taken back 100%. I wish I could show you the maps of what it was before and what it was after. Sarah, maybe you could ask somebody to bring me those maps. The — ISIS, when I got there, and ISIS when I left. Right now, there is no ISIS. ISIS has — the entire caliphate is down. Remember when it was 99% gone and I started moving people out. They said “He didn’t finish the job.” Anyway, so — The individual mandate of Obamacare. We ended it. That’s where you had to pay for — These were the laws, President Bush had them, President Obama had them. I had them. And when I had them, everybody went wild about separation, nobody talked about separation before. But Obama, President Obama is the one that built the jail cells, as they called them, and they said “Look at these cells, isn’t this terrible?” I said, wait a minute — and we didn’t know that, and then they stepped forward — those pictures were perhaps in your magazine in 2014. That was long before I became President. They spent a tiny amount of money — just so you understand, and as the report makes very clear, there was no collusion, there was no conspiracy — This isn’t over. This is a negotiation. Don’t underestimate the fact, and the other thing is in the trade deal, which assuming it gets approved, Mexico’s paying hundreds of billions of dollars over a period of time more than they were paying previously. I mean can that count for a wall that’s a fraction of the numbers you’re talking about? You know, in the U.S.M.C.A. That deal is .. .in other words, that deal is much more lucrative for the United States than NAFTA. Time will tell. Only time will tell. Uh — I don’t know. Look, I think I’ve done so much. Could you bring the list of things, please, give me four of them. Uh, yeah. Will you show me that letter, the birthday letter, do you have it? Get it for me. I’ll show it to you. We got our prisoners back. We don’t have nuclear testing. We don’t have any testing, we don’t have — other than short-range missiles, which they did a couple of like every other countries test short-term, these were standard short-term missiles — there are no ballistic missiles being tested. There’s no nuclear tests, and we have a very good relationship. We’re studying it all. I mean, it’s a very evolving topic, but I am for exceptions. Well — look — I also said Iran is not going to have a nuclear weapon, you know, which is very important. As you know in Afghanistan, when I got there, it was 16,000 people. It’s now 9,000 people. And some good things are happening there frankly. No, I’d like to get out of the Middle East, we should have never been in the Middle East. We should have never been there, and I’d like to get out. Well, here’s what I don’t — I’ll go a step further. It was a crime committed by the other side. Not only was there no crime on my side, and he found no collusion and he found no conspiracy, right, do you agree with that? No conspiracy, no collusion, no nothing? Well, I don’t have a bet. I think that Biden is not the same Biden. Something’s going on there. O.K.? I would say that probably a progressive wins. Look, when a progressive gets out, another progressive is going to take 100% of the vote, so it’s — Well, I don’t think too many people don’t believe it. I think people say they don’t believe it because they don’t want to get drawn in. But they don’t, they don’t, uh, they don’t believe it. Well, I told you the following. I told you you can look at this off-the-record. That doesn’t mean you take out your camera and start taking pictures of it. O.K.? So I hope you don’t have a picture of it. I know you were very quick to pull it out — even you were surprised to see that. You can’t do that stuff. So go have fun with your story. Because I’m sure it will be the 28th horrible story I have in TIME Magazine because I never — I mean — ha. It’s incredible. With all I’ve done and the success I’ve had, the way that TIME Magazine writes is absolutely incredible. Well, I wouldn’t even want to say that, but I would certainly go over nuclear weapons, and I would keep the other a question mark. Shea? Ask them to bring in the documents I saw yesterday. Well, I’ll tell you what, I’m going to let the protesters speak for themselves. I have our own argument with China, and I think it’s going to work out successfully, but I’m going to let China and the protesters work out their own problem. It looks like it’s going to be worked out. Well, I’ve said, you know what? I’ve answered it so many different ways — I answered it in Stephanopoulos, I answered the same question on Fox. But number one, I don’t think they’d do it with me because they know I love the country — Well, look, it starts as of tomorrow. But for the first eight or nine months, it’ll be very, much more limited. Probably one rally every two, three weeks. And then it will get tighter. And then, you know I did six or seven a day toward the end of the campaign. Well, look, my message is that they’re obviously having a big impact, because it’s been pulled back and it will be pulled back further. And I think that they’ve been very effective in their dealings with China. By the way, I have a very good relationship with China, just that they’ve treated us unfairly with respect to trade for many years. Since the WTO, we’ve been treated unfairly. We’ve helped create China. I give them a lot of credit, but we’ve helped create China. You look at what’s happened over the last period of time, and China wants to make a deal. They actually had a deal with us. We were very close to having a deal, and then they pulled back on three major points that were just unacceptable to me. So I’m very happy now collecting 25% on $250 billion, which is what we’re doing. But China wants to make a deal, and I don’t blame them, because companies are leaving China by the hundreds because they don’t want to pay the tariffs. So China’s going to want to make a deal. Well, one of the things that seems to be rather ridiculous — also, Shea, do me a favor. Will you get the information I had yesterday — the people that benefit from the Straits. The companies, countries that benefit from the Straits. Just — I want to show you something. China gets 60% of their oil there. Japan 25% of their oil. So many of the other places get such vast amounts of oil there. We get very little. You know, we have made tremendous progress in the last 2-1/2 years in energy, and when the pipelines get built, we’re now an exporter of energy. So we’re not in the position that we were in, that we used to be in in the Middle East where we needed — you know we were there — some people would say we were there for the oil. Well, so far, it’s been very minor. And so far, if you look at the rhetoric now compared to the days when they were signing that agreement, where it was always, “Death to America, death to America, we will destroy America, we will kill America.” I’m not hearing that too much any more, and I don’t expect to, by the way. I don’t expect to. A lot difference. Rhetorically you understand. Well, there’s 550 miles. 550 is max. Well, they had that under Obama’s watch, too. Well, they have lists. They have very accurate lists actually. But you have to understand, they were separated with President Obama. They were separated with President Bush. I didn’t change the policy, and the policy had been changed, it was — I’m the one that ended separation. Just so we understand. And when we ended separation, and I was not surprised to see this, more families came up because now they’re not going to be separated. Well, we’re just starting that process, but other countries are a bigger beneficiary of that part of the world now than we are. Far bigger. Well, yeah, I think they pick up close to 100%. I think they pick up much of that vote. I think that Harris has not surged, as they say. I think that Bernie is going in the wrong direction. I think Biden is going in the wrong direction. He’s dropped a lot. He’s come down a lot. If you look at our friend Pocahontas, she is doing pretty well. She’s doing pretty well. They forgot that she’s a fraud. She’s doing … you know she’s the one that’s doing, it seems, the best in terms of that. I don’t believe Mayor Pete has a chance, I never did. I don’t see it. Well, you know, I’m open whenever they’re ready. Let’s see, we have a long way to go before we get there, but I’m open when they’re ready. But if you remember, sometimes it’s hard to place yourself back in time, but if you go back 2-1/2 years, we had an absolute disaster going on. It was — Iran was causing problems like nobody’ — What was that?! Who? With all I’ve done, with the tremendous success I’ve had, that TIME Magazine writes about me the way they write is a disgrace, O.K.? Let’s face it, it’s a disgrace. And some day within the next 20 years, maybe you’ll pick me as Man of the Year. O.K., big deal. But with all that we’ve said, now — go back to the Mueller Report. You have 18 people who hated Donald Trump, who were angry Democrats, many of whom supported the Democratic Party financially. Right? You have Bob Mueller who was conflicted, totally conflicted. You know my feeling on that. Comey was his friend. I had a nasty business dispute with him when he was in private life. A very nasty business dispute. Right? You know about that, right? Yeah, but they do with every — maybe they do. And by the way, I would be surprised if it was only Russia — Yeah, I think they’d be making a big mistake doing that. Yes, please. You do know this, right Sarah? You had to pay not to pay for insurance — to pay a fortune for the privilege of not paying. One of the most unpopular part. We’ll get great healthcare after — if we win back the House. And keep the Senate. Keep the presidency. You mean if they helped the opponent? We are now bringing people back into Mexico. Which is a pretty shocking thing. You look at China, it’s a big beneficiary — they don’t pay anything. Japan is a big beneficiary, they don’t pay anything. Many other countries, they don’t pay anything. Indonesia. Many other countries come, they don’t pay anything. And we’re there keeping the world as, you know, we’re there keeping the oil flowing. Right? And the amazing thing is we’re now an exporter, so in theory, we’re a beneficiary of oil problems. But I don’t view it that way."
,,"Today, I am here to talk about three crucial words that should be at the center of our foreign policy: Peace Through Strength.  We want to achieve a stable, peaceful world with less conflict and more common ground.  I am proposing a new foreign policy focused on advancing America’s core national interests, promoting regional stability, and producing an easing of tensions in the world. This will require rethinking the failed policies of the past.  We can make new friends, rebuild old alliances, and bring new allies into the fold.  I’m proud to have the support of warfighting generals, active duty military, and the top experts who know both how to win – and how to avoid the endless wars we are caught in now. Just yesterday, 88 top Generals and Admirals endorsed my campaign.  In a Trump Administration, our actions in the Middle East will be tempered by realism. The current strategy of toppling regimes, with no plan for what to do the day after, only produces power vacuums that are filled by terrorists.  Gradual reform, not sudden and radical change, should be our guiding objective in that region.  We should work with any country that shares our goal of destroying ISIS and defeating Radical Islamic terrorism, and form new friendships and partnerships based on this mission. We now have an Administration, and a former Secretary of State, who refuse to say Radical Islamic Terrorism.  Immediately after taking office, I will ask my generals to present to me a plan within 30 days to defeat and destroy ISIS.  This will require military warfare, but also cyber warfare, financial warfare, and ideological warfare – as I laid out in my speech on defeating Radical Islamic terrorism several weeks ago.  Instead of an apology tour, I will proudly promote our system of government and our way of life as the best in the world – just like we did in our campaign against communism during the Cold War.  We will show the whole world how proud we are to be American.  At the same time, immigration security is a vital part of our national security.  We only want to admit people to our country who will support our values and love our people.  These are the pillars of a sound national security strategy.  Unlike my opponent, my foreign policy will emphasize diplomacy, not destruction. Hillary Clinton’s legacy in Iraq, Libya, and Syria has produced only turmoil and suffering. Her destructive policies have displaced millions of people, then she has invited the refugees into the West with no plan to screen them.  Including Veteran healthcare costs, the price of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan could total $6 trillion, according to a report in the Washington Examiner. Yet, after all this money spent and lives lost, Clinton’s policies as Secretary of State have left the Middle East in more disarray than ever before.  Meanwhile, China has grown more aggressive, and North Korea more dangerous and belligerent. Russia has defied this Administration at every turn. Putin has no respect for President Obama or Hillary Clinton.  Sometimes it has seemed like there wasn’t a country in the Middle East that Hillary Clinton didn’t want to invade, intervene or topple. She is trigger-happy and unstable when it comes to war.  Hillary Clinton is just reckless – so reckless, in fact, she put her emails on an illegal server that our enemies could easily hack. Then Clinton’s team used a technology called bleachbit to acid wash her emails. They even took a hammer to some of her 13 phones, to cover her tracks and obstruct justice. These email records were destroyed after she received a subpoena to turn them over.  In the FBI report, she claimed she couldn’t recall important information on 39 occasions.  She can’t even remember whether she was trained in classified information, and said she didn’t even know the letter “C” means confidential.  If she can’t remember such crucial events and information, she is unfit to be Commander-in-Chief.  Her conduct is simply disqualifying.  She talks about her experience, but Hillary Clinton’s only foreign policy experience is “failure.” Everywhere she got involved, things got worse.  Let’s look back at the Middle East at the very beginning of 2009, before Hillary Clinton was sworn-in.  Libya was stable.  Syria was under control.  Egypt was ruled by a secular President and an ally of the United States.  Iraq was experiencing a reduction in violence. The group that would become what we now call ISIS was close to being extinguished.  Iran was being choked off by economic sanctions.  Fast-forward to today. What have the decisions of Obama-Clinton produced?  Libya is in ruins, our ambassador and three other brave Americans are dead, and ISIS has gained a new base of operations.  Syria is in the midst of a disastrous civil war. ISIS controls large portions of territory. A refugee crisis now threatens Europe and the United States. And hundreds of thousands are dead.  In Egypt, terrorists have gained a foothold in the Sinai desert, near the Suez Canal, one of the most essential waterways in the world.  Iraq is in chaos, and ISIS is on the loose.  ISIS has spread across the Middle East, and into the West.  Iran, the world’s largest state sponsor of terrorism, is now flush with $150 billion dollars in cash released by the United States – plus another $1.7 billion dollars in cash ransom payments. In other words, our country was blackmailed and extorted into paying this unheard-of amount of money.  Worst of all, the Nuclear deal puts Iran, the number one state sponsor of Radical Islamic terrorism, on a path to nuclear weapons.  This is Hillary Clinton’s foreign policy legacy.  But that’s not all. President Obama and Hillary Clinton have also overseen deep cuts in our military, which only invite more aggression from our adversaries.  History shows that when America is not prepared is when the danger is greatest. We want to deter, avoid and prevent conflict through our unquestioned military strength.  Under Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, defense spending is on track to fall to its lowest level as a share of the economy since the end of World War II. We currently have the smallest Army since 1940. The Navy is among the smallest it has been since 1915. And the Air Force is the smallest it has been since 1947.  When Ronald Reagan left office, our Navy had 592 ships. When Barack Obama took office, it had 285 ships. Today, the Navy has just 276 ships.  The average Air Force aircraft is 27 years-old. We have 2nd generation B-52 bombers – their fathers flew the same plane.  Our Army has been shrinking rapidly, from 553,000 soldiers in 2009 to just 479,000 today.  In 2009, our Marine Corps had 202,000 active Marines. Today, it’s just 182,000.  Our ship count is below the minimum of 308 that the Navy says is needed to execute its current missions. President Obama plans to reduce the Army to 450,000 troops—which would hamstring our ability to defend the United States.  It takes 22 years on average to field a major new weapons system.  In 2010, the US spent $554 billion on non-war base defense spending.  In the current year, we are spending $548 billion – a cut of 10% in real inflation-adjusted dollars. This reduction was done through what is known as the sequester, or automatic defense budget cuts. Under the budget agreement, defense took half of the cuts – even though it makes up only one-sixth of the budget.  As soon as I take office, I will ask Congress to fully eliminate the defense sequester and will submit a new budget to rebuild our military.  This will increase certainty in the defense community as to funding, and will allow military leaders to plan for our future defense needs.  As part of removing the defense sequester, I will ask Congress to fully offset the costs of increased military spending. In the process, we will make government leaner and more responsive to the public.  I will ask that savings be accomplished through common sense reforms that eliminate government waste and budget gimmicks – and that protect hard-earned benefits for Americans.  Government-wide, improper government payments are estimated to exceed $135 billion per year, and the amount of unpaid taxes is estimated to be as high as $385 billion.  We can also reduce the size of the federal bureaucracy through responsible workforce attrition – that is, when employees retire, they can be replaced by a smaller number of new employees.  We can also stop funding programs that are not authorized in law. Congress spent $320 billion last year on 256 expired laws. Removing just 5 percent of that will reduce spending by almost $200 billion over 10 years.  The military will not be exempt either – the military bureaucracy will have to be trimmed as well.  Early in my term, I will also be requesting that all NATO nations promptly pay their bills, which many are not doing right now. Only 5 NATO countries, including the United States, are currently meeting the minimum requirement to spend 2% of GDP on defense.  Additionally, I will be respectfully asking countries such as Germany, Japan, South Korea and Saudi Arabia to pay more for the tremendous security we provide them.  Finally, we will have at our disposal additional revenues from unleashing American energy. The Institute for Energy Research cites a “short-run” figure of as much as $36 billion annually from increased energy production.  Using these new funds, I will ask my Secretary of Defense to propose a new defense budget to meet the following long-term goals:  We will build an active Army of around 540,000, as the Army’s chief of staff has said he needs. We now have only 31 Brigade Combat Teams, or 490,000 troops, and only one-third of combat teams are considered combat-ready.  We will build a Marine Corps based on 36 battalions, which the Heritage Foundation notes is the minimum needed to deal with major contingencies – we have 23 now.  We will build a Navy of 350 surface ships and submarines, as recommended by the bipartisan National Defense Panel – we have 276 ships now.  And we will build an Air Force of at least 1,200 fighter aircraft, which the Heritage Foundation has shown to be needed to execute current missions – we have 1,113 now.  We will also seek to develop a state of the art missile defense system.  Under Obama-Clinton, our ballistic missile defense capability has been degraded at the very moment the US and its allies are facing a heightened missile threat from states like Iran and North Korea. As these potential adversaries grow their missile programs, US military facilities in Asia and the Middle East, as well as our allies, are increasingly in range, with the United States homeland also potentially threatened.  We propose to rebuild the key tools of missile defense, starting with the Navy cruisers that are the foundation of our missile defense capabilities in Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. The Obama-Clinton administration tried repeatedly to remove our cruisers from service, then refused to modernize these aging ships.  We will start by modernizing our cruisers to provide the Ballistic Missile Defense capability our nation needs; this will cost around $220 million per modernization as we seek to modernize a significant portion of these 22 ships.  As we expand our Navy toward the goal of 350 ships, we will also procure additional modern destroyers that are designed to handle the missile defense mission in the coming years.  Accomplishing this military rebuild will be a fifty-state effort —every state in the union will be able to take part in rebuilding our military and developing the technologies oftomorrow.  In addition, we will improve the Department of Defense’s cyber capabilities. Hillary Clinton has taught us all how vulnerable we are to cyber hacking.  Which is why one of the first things we must do is to enforce all classification rules, and enforce all laws relating to the handling of classified information.  Hillary Clinton put her emails on a secret server to cover-up her pay-for-play scandals at the State Department. Nothing threatens the integrity of our Democracy more than when government officials put their public office up for sale.  We will also make it a priority to develop defensive and offensive cyber capabilities at our U.S. Cyber Command, and recruit the best and brightest Americans.  One of my first directives after taking office will be asking the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and all relevant federal departments, to conduct a thorough review of United States cyber defenses and identify all vulnerabilities – in our power grid, our communications systems, and all vital infrastructure. I will then ask for a plan to immediately protect those vulnerabilities. At the same time, we will invest heavily in offensive cyber capabilities to disrupt our enemies, including terrorists who rely heavily on internet communications.  These new investments in cybersecurity, and the modernization of our military, will spur substantial new job creation in the private sector and help create the jobs and technologies of tomorrow.  America must be the world’s dominant technological powerhouse of the 21st century, and young Americans – including in our inner cities – should get these new jobs.  We must also ensure that we have the best medical care, education and support for our military service members and their families – both when they serve, and when they return to civilian life.  Our debt to our men and women in uniform is eternal.  To all those who have served this nation, I say: I will never let you down.  We will protect those who protect us.  And we will follow their example of unity. We will work across all racial and income lines to create One American Nation.  Together, we will have one great American future.  We will be one people, under one God, saluting one American flag.  America will be a prosperous, generous and inclusive society.  We will discard the failed policies and division of the past, and embrace true American change to rebuild our economy, rebuild our inner cities, and rebuild our country.  We Will Bring Back Our Jobs.  We Will Make America Strong Again.  We Will Make America Safe Again.  And We Will Make America Great Again."
,,"…but he had nothing to do with my—he was involved, but he had nothing to do with our victory. And he was there two months—what was it two months after? So, I beat 17 people, OK? So, Michael, you know politics, perhaps better than me. …The deputy attorney general, who’s in charge of the case, wanted—all you have to do is read his letter. So that’s— there’s no obstruction there. And I really believe they have good intention. After we’re finished with DACA, assuming that gets done, I would certainly be open to discussing—you know, the comprehensive immigration. I don’t know that we’ll be able to make a deal on that one. And others, I mean I could take you around to the back and I could show you many people, If you don’t—and some of them you wouldn’t know their names so (inaudible). Steve was—I always liked Steve, but Steve became very ineffective because he was such a lightning rod. And, maybe, it’s possible to get it. You know, that’s what I do, I make deals. Despite what you read with—by these people that don’t know me, that were never interviewed by—to me, you know. And, obviously, we never intended (inaudible). Approximately—so it will be actually $1.8 trillion of investment in our infrastructure which will largely rebuild our infrastructure. But I thought he was very elegant. I always say, “You’re the elegant host.” But just so you understand… But, it was a full pager and essentially said there’s never been a president that’s been anywhere close on regulation. And you know, just so we understand. We need regulation, but we don’t need 19 different roadblocks getting to the same place and that’s what we had. And we have a long way to go, we’re cutting actually quite a bit of additional regulation. We’re looking at Dodd-Frank very strongly and I think we’ll have something on that. By the way, that’s a treasonous act. What he tweeted to his lover is a treasonous act. David had more to do with it. Many people— I mean, there were many people—it’s a little before Sarah’s time. If you were here, you would have had more to do with it. No, I talked to Steve very little; I didn’t know Steve well, believe it or not. They made it sound like—I mean when that guy wrote the book about Steve. Don’t forget, I had vanquished 17 governors, senators plus a couple of very smart people, like Ben and Carly and others. I had vanquished them easily—easily. I won every debate based on the polls. You know, they do polls—seven or eight polls. Time Magazine—Time Magazine’s not a fan of mine. For instance, at the very beginning, you know Obama felt—President Obama felt it was his biggest problem is North Korea. He said that openly. He said that to me, but he said that openly. It is a big problem, and they should not have left me with that problem. That should have been a problem that was solved by Obama, or Bush, or Clinton or anybody, because the longer it went, the worse, the more difficult the problem got. This should not have been a problem left on my desk, but it is, and I get things solved. And one way or the other, that problem is going to be solved. Getting close. Go ahead. I do ask you this, treat me fairly. I do? I don’t have to because the wall is the same wall I’ve always talked about. I can understand why I have to have see-through. I don’t know if Congress has the guts to do that. I don’t know, Gary, are you staying on? I don’t want to comment on it—I don’t want to comment, I’m not saying I have or I haven’t. But I just don’t— I hope so. Hey, look, I got elected president. I won easily, 306 or 304, depending on your definition, to 223. I won a race that should never be won by a Republican because it’s so stacked in the Democrats’ favor. I mean, if you figure California, New York, and Illinois, you start off with losing that—you have to run the entire East Coast and every— and the entire Midwest. I never said the wall’s going to be two thousand, but there are—there is a vast amount of territory where nobody comes through. I will let you know. But if I were them I would try. But the difference is I’m president; other people aren’t. And I know more about wedges than any human being that’s ever lived, but I’ll let you know. But I’ll tell you, you know, when you talk about driving a wedge, we also have a thing called trade. And South Korea—brilliantly makes—we have a trade deficit with South Korea of $31 billion a year. That’s a pretty strong bargaining chip to me. I would like to see that. Yeah, I’d like to be able to—look, nobody gets more false press than I do. Nobody—nobody gets—nobody comes close. In history—in the history of this country nobody’s gotten more false press and you guys all know it. I’ll let you know in—within the next 12 months, OK, Mike? I’ll see the level of it. I’m not sure that markets would dip; I think that markets would—I can tell you I’m not sure about world markets, but I can tell you I think the American market would go up if I terminated Nafta and renegotiated a new deal. If I’m standing here, I want to be able to see 200 yards out. I want to be able to see, I don’t want to have a piece of concrete that I can’t see. If we don’t make the right deal, I will terminate Nafta. OK? If you don’t know who’s there, you’ve got a problem. Is that—they’re going to build them here, they’re going to build other things here too. It’s going to be a combination of public/private which is now the new hot topic. We’ll be putting up approximately $200 billion. It could be as much as $1.8 trillion spent. We have many, many, wealthy countries, some of whom our country made wealthy, but we have many countries, any people that really want to put up tremendous amounts of money for the infrastructure. That gets it built faster, gets it built better, gets it built on time, on budget and the United States won’t be putting up all of the money. It’s selling itself, Michael. Michael, it’s selling itself. Just—and so—so I was successful, successful, successful. I was always the best athlete, people don’t know that. But I was successful at everything I ever did and then I run for president, first time—first time, not three times, not six times. I ran for president first time and lo and behold, I win. And then people say oh, is he a smart person? I’m smarter than all of them put together, but they can’t admit it. They had a bad year. Let me, let me tell you something about the wall. So I’ve always said we have to have a wall. I’ve also said Mexico’s got to pay for it—sometimes you know on occasion, I’d add who’s going to pay for it? Mexico. Well they will pay for it, OK? There are many forms of payment. I could name 10 right now. There are many forms of payment, I didn’t say how. Look, there has never been in the history of this country an administration that, number one, did nothing wrong, and number two, was more open with a special counsel. We have—my lawyers are very good people. We made a decision right at the beginning. And it wasn’t their original idea. They figured, like, well, we’ll fight this (inaudible). No but it’s getting close. They—want, I feel, you know, I have great feeling for DACA. I think that we should be able to do something with DACA. I think it’s foolish if we don’t, they’ve been here a long time, they’re no longer children, you know. People talk of them as children, I mean some are 41 years old and older. But some are in their teens, and late teens, but nevertheless I think we should do something with DACA and I think we should do something to help people. No, but, you know, I’m leaving it a little flexible because they have an election coming up. So I understand a lot of things are hard to negotiate prior to an election. They have an election coming up fairly shortly, and I understand that that makes it a little bit difficult for them, and I’m not looking to make the other side—so we’ll either make a deal or—there’s no rush, but I will say that if we don’t make a fair deal for this country, a Trump deal, then we’re not going to have—then we’re going to have a—I will terminate. No, I just want them to be tough, be strong. I also think that primary collusion, because there was no collusion on our side, the collusion was on the Democrat side with the Russians. And what went on with the FBI, where a man is tweeting to his lover that if she loses, we’ll essentially go back to the—we’ll go to the insurance policy, which is—if they lose, we’ll go to phase 2, and we’ll get this guy out of office. No, I never did; I never knew about it. No, I think—I just want them to—look, all I see of these Democrats, like Adam Schiff —it’s all he does, he’ll have a meeting, and then he’ll leave, and he’ll call up the meeting, and then I’ll have a meeting and then he’ll leave. He left meetings where people are being interviewed, and then all of a sudden they say a story about what’s going on inside the meetings. No, never out of the military. No—no, no. Nothing comes out of the military. We’re making the military strong, again. Just the opposite—we’re building the military budget very substantially; you know that. No, no I support the idea of discussing it. No, this is the same. I hope I don’t read tomorrow, Trump is going to make the wall, I always said, we need a wall. No. This will be—this will be money that we will find. There’s a lot of places to find $200 billion. There are not a lot of places to find $1.8 trillion. I see Gary shaking his head, yes; correct? $200 billion sounds like a lot but relative to what we’re talking about it’s a number that we can easily handle. Not helpful enough, but they’ve been very helpful. Let’s put it this way, they’ve done more for me than they ever have for any American president. They still haven’t done enough. But they’ve done more for me than they have, by far, for any—I have a very good relationship with President Xi. I like him. He likes me. We have a great chemistry together. He’s—China has done far more for us than they ever have for any American president. With that being said, it’s not enough. They have to do more. Now on the wall we have cameras and we have highly sophisticated equipment, but the wall—the Border Patrol tells me the other way’s more expensive. It’s not less expensive. We have to have vision through the wall. Of course there was no obstruction—excuse me. Of course there was no obstruction. But there was no crime. So now they’re saying, could there be—now, I haven’t even heard that they’re looking at obstruct—I don’t know that they’re looking at obstruction. Oh I do? Oh, I know it’s the time. But look, hey, Gary may leave and Rex may leave but I don’t anticipate it. I hope Gary stays and we’ll see. OK, all right, well we’ll do as much as we can. OK, get me a list of those people. OK, people think they’re interchangeable, but they’re not. One thing nobody anticipated was that these companies would come in and pay all of this money to the employees—to millions and millions of employees. And AT&T started it, but it was picked up by Comcast and another one. Ready? Comprehensive immigration reform is a far step from DACA. I am always open to discussing everything but that doesn’t mean we’re going to get anywhere close to getting it done. Right. Right. Say it again? So that’s a very different—very different topic. Sure, you see that a lot with me and then all of a sudden somebody’s my best friend. I could give you 20 examples. You give me 30. I’m a very flexible person. Thank you very much. That’s a different discussion. That’s comprehensive—well, if we could do that, that’s fine. I don’t know that that’s going to be possible. The $200 billion? The man with the three hour interview, he spent three hours—the man who said he spent three hours in the Oval Office who I never met once in the White House. OK, you know—despite all these characters that are—that’s something you can talk about, is the libel laws, because we’ve got to increase our libel laws so when people make misstatements, like yourselves, but when people make misstatements somebody has some, you know, recourse. The other thing…so the wall. The wall’s never meant to be 2,100 miles long. We have mountains that are far better than a wall, we have violent rivers that nobody goes near, we have areas... The tax bill has turned out to be far greater than we ever anticipated. There has never been, in the history—in the history of an administration anybody that was more open than we were. You understand that? They can pay for it through, as an example, they can pay for it indirectly through Nafta. OK? You know, we make a good deal on Nafta, say I’m going to take a small percentage of that money and it’s going to go toward the wall. Guess what? Mexico’s paying. Now Mexico may not want to make the Nafta deal and which is OK, then I’ll terminate Nafta…which I think would be frankly a positive for our country. I don’t think it’s a positive for Mexico, I don’t think it’s a positive for the world. But it’s a positive for our country because I’d make a much better deal. There is no deal that I can make on Nafta that’s as good as if I terminate Nafta and make a new deal. OK? But I feel that we have a chance of making a reasonable deal, the way it is now. They dislike me, the liberal media dislikes me. I mean I watch people—I was always the best at what I did, I was the—I was, you know, I went to the—I went to the Wharton School of Finance, did well. I went out, I—I started in Brooklyn, in a Brooklyn office with my father, I became one of the most successful real-estate developers, one of the most successful business people. I created maybe the greatest brand. They don’t want to talk about that—they don’t want to talk about the biggest tax bill (inaudible). This is going to be state of the art wall; this will be state of the art. But, I can fully understand why you’d have to have vision. I’d like to be able to see three or four hundred yards instead of we’re at a wall we have no idea who’s on the other side. Does this make sense or am I just wasting my time. We are absolutely—at the appropriate time and first of all we’re working on different solutions. We gave them everything. We didn’t go to court and say, “You can’t have this document, you can’t have”—and what we gave them showed—I never got a phone call from Russia. I didn’t have a tweet. I didn’t have a—I had nothing. I didn’t have an email. I didn’t have a meeting. I didn’t have—did I have one meeting with—about Russia? And... We’ll do it—every month we’ll do one of these. But—because I do respect and I love and I think [WSJ editor in chief] Gerard [Baker]—I always call him the most elegant debate—I thought it was the best debate, maybe because I like that one good from my standpoint. We’ll find out. But people do leave. You guys may leave The Wall Street Journal, right? We’re going to be very careful. We’re going to be very, very, careful about Russia—and about anybody else, by the way. Well allow—let me—(inaudible). So, they make up a crime, and the crime doesn’t exist. And then they say obstruction. And how could there be obstruction on firing Comey? When the man who’s in charge of it wrote a letter that was far stronger than anything I would have written. He was in charge—Deputy Rosenstein. He wrote a letter that’s far stronger than even what I say. Well I think we’re going to start with infrastructure. We’re very far down the line. Gary [Cohn] actually met with Elizabeth Warren yesterday and I heard, actually, had a very good conversation. My team met—Gary, you had a whole group of people—and they had a good conversation. We’ll start with infrastructure and we’ll see. If we do infrastructure I think that has to be bipartisan—and I think it will be. I think we’ll have a lot of Democrat support. Well, I’d rather talk to you about that later because honestly, we’re doing infrastructure first; OK? We’ll do that again. Well, I’m not talking amnesty at all. I’m not talking amnesty at all, that’s the other thing. No, I think my base is with me. My base feels that these 800 thousand young people should not be thrown out of the country, OK? My base is with me and now I you know; and I think my base actually gets bigger. Well, that’s not a large amount. I mean—think of this—I hate to say it but it’s not my fault and I did not want to go into Iraq, by the way. But as of two months ago we’re into the Middle East for $7 trillion. We made a lot of headway in the Middle East, by the way. I’ve knocked out ISIS and Syria and Iraq and all but— and we’re doing well in Afghanistan for the first time ever. But you’ll see the results over the next three or four months like you won’t believe. What he said about my son is horrible. My son had a brief meeting based on the fact that he thought whatever he thought. And he—somebody said bad stuff on an opponent. I don’t know of one politician in Washington—if you’re a politician and somebody called up that they have information on your opponent that might be negative. Yeah, be really clear, I’d like to—because I love The Wall Street Journal. I hope that you guys are clear. OK. Yeah, go ahead. Yeah, I do, I would—I would say—I don’t know that I’ll be able to get it though—but I think that when somebody makes false statements and libelous statements, whether it’s in a book or a newspaper or anything else. When they have phony sources, when the sources don’t exist, yeah I think they should have a liability. Yeah, Rex and I are getting along very well. Yes, I do. I feel betrayed because you’re not supposed to do that, but I have many people that work for me who were far more important than Steve, right there. Yes. You know what? I like him. I like him. I like them all. You never know, you know again, the word—– I don’t know what the word permanent means, OK? I never know what the word permanent means. We’ll see what happens, but Steve had nothing to do with my win. Well, certainly very little. You understand what I mean. You’re the first one that’s asked that question. No, I don’t think anybody thinks that I’m bending. I think that people that, if anything, I’m being too tough. You’ve been doing it longer, OK? That’s the other thing I’ve only been doing this for two years, two and a half years, OK? You know, it’s pretty good. When they said Jeb Bush was off his game; Trump killed him in the debate. Jeb was off his game because he hasn’t been governor now. He’s been out of politics for eight years. Oh, really? I’ve been out of politics for—I was never in politics. Mr. Trump:…I mean I actually read it because I’ve never seen a full page—it’s actually a full page article. No, I think it’s inappropriate to have the Olympics, have millions of people going to the Olympics hopefully, have North Korea going to the Olympics, and we’re having exercises on the beach. No, I think that it doesn’t—I think it sends a good message to North Korea, not a bad message. I think it would be totally inappropriate to do that during the Olympics. Now, do I want to? No, I’d rather leave it, but I feel that if that if—you know, the United States has been treated very, very badly. That has been a terrible agreement for us, and if we don’t make a good deal for our country—we lose $71 billion in trade deficits with Mexico. We lose $17 billion with Canada. If we don’t make a fair deal for the United States and the United States taxpayer, then I will terminate it. Now, I could of done it differently. I’ve been, you know, pretty successful in the courts over the years, I’ve been a very successful person, you can check—USA Today said, “he does great in the courts,” OK? Our air-traffic control doesn’t work. They have spent billions and billions of dollars on it over the last seven years. Billions and it’s worthless. They had many different contractors doing many different locations using all different computers and computer companies. And when they hooked it up it didn’t work. So, I’m good at that stuff—we’ll fix it. So I just want to be crystal clear about this, you’re open to discussing comprehensive immigration reform, are you open to discussing a path to citizenship as part of that? So the lottery has to end, chain migration—he brought in they say 22 people through the chain. So we have 22 of his relatives, why? And I honestly think that the Democrats are with us on that. We’ll find out. I mean who wouldn’t be? Who wouldn’t be? Unless it’s somebody that didn’t love our country, and the Democrats love our country. We have different views but the Democrats love our country. So there’s no—you have a no-crime that was created, you have a phony crime and then they talk about obstruction. And how can they talk about obstruction when I was the most open person, in history, in terms of—there’s never been a paper we didn’t give them, there’s never been a question we didn’t answer. So yeah, I think, Michael, I think we have a good chance to make a deal. We have to have a wall. We don’t have a wall, we’re not doing the deal. So—I—I think we have a very good chance of making a deal on DACA, I would like to be able to do it; I think that the people that are Trump supporters agree with me on it. I would never do it without a wall, the wall is the wall and it’s the same wall that we’re always talking about. It’s—you know, wherever we need, we don’t need it where you have mountains; you don’t need it where you have rivers and—you know, vicious rivers. So—so we have sort of natural barriers. So, if we do welfare reform it’s going to have to be bipartisan. So, just to finish, everybody wanted Comey fired. And then, when I fired, I never forget, when I fired, all these people that had just said, “You’ve got fire Comey”, they said, “oh, he just fired Comey.” Well now they’re—the—on the other side, they’re Democrats. So all of a sudden they change. So, sort of interesting, but when I won against the 17 people, you can’t then say that oh, gee, somebody comes in two months after I won, and he gives me new policy, new idea. I can’t change those ideas, those ideas are wedded. Steve’s greatest asset is he was able to convince a corrupt media that he was responsible for my win. Hope, just out of curiosity, you were there from day one. What do you think Steve in a percentage had to do with my victory? That will include bridges, roadways, tunnels; it will include many things. One of the things we’re doing separate of that will be air-traffic control. Our air-traffic control is from a different planet. It’s horrible. It’s a horrible mess. That’s one of the reasons NBC hates me so much. NBC hates me so much they wanted—they were desperate to sign me for—for three more years. The governor of Wisconsin has been fantastic in their presentations and everything else. But I’m the one who got them to look at it. Now we need people because they’re going to have thousands of people working it’s going to be a—you know—that’s—that’s the company that makes the Apple iPhone. The other thing is, everybody wanted Comey fired. And, another thing, and this is just a few, Comey has proven to be a leaker and a liar and, if anything, I should get credit for firing him because it turned out I was right because many thing have been found out about Comey that—I mean, I should be given credit for having great insight because many things have been found out about Comey that would never have been found out if I didn’t fire him. There’s a lot of—there’s a lot of—there’s a big difference—first of all, there’s a big difference between DACA and Dreamers, OK? They both endorsed me, the only time they’ve ever endorsed a presidential candidate, OK? And they endorsed us unanimously. I had meetings with them, they need see-through. So, we need a form of fence or window. I said why you need that—makes so much sense? They said because we have to see who’s on the other side. This person on the west side that killed eight people and badly, you heard me say yesterday, badly, badly wounded about 12. I mean people losing arms and legs—nobody even talks about that. But they say killed eight and that’s it. I mean you have people—ones walking around without—missing two legs. And the person was running to stay in shape and now he’s missing two legs. Think of it."
